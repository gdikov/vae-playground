Various Experiments with Variational Autoencoders 
=========

## Description

This repository builds on top of my implementation of AVB [1]. It contains the following experiments using VAEs:
 * A conjoint VAE model trained on multiple datasets jointly with a shared latent representation.
 * ...
 
## Requirements

The requirements are the same as for avb repo. Please refer to the `requirements.txt` for working package versions.
